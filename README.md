# Unity Bookmark Manager

The Unity Bookmark Manager is a simple editor window that allows you to create a list of bookmarks for any Unity objects. This can be useful for quickly accessing frequently used assets or game objects during development.

## How to Use

To use the bookmark manager, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `BookmarkWindow.cs` script into a C# file in your Unity project's `Assets` folder.
2. In the Unity editor, go to the `Window` menu and select `Bookmark Manager` to open the bookmark manager window.
3. To add a new bookmark, click the `+` button in the upper left corner of the window. This will add a new empty bookmark to the list.
4. To assign an object to a bookmark, click on the object field in the bookmark row and select the desired object from the Unity object selector window.
5. To remove a bookmark, click the `-` button to the right of the bookmark row.
6. To reorder bookmarks, click and drag a bookmark row to the desired position in the list.

The bookmark manager will automatically save your list of bookmarks to a JSON file in your project's persistent data path (`Application.persistentDataPath`) whenever you make a change. When you reopen the bookmark manager window, your saved bookmarks will be loaded automatically.
